# ADR-0005: Rename state.ts to entity.ts

## Context
The pure state machine was originally stored in `state.ts`. To better match the glossary and emphasize that it represents an Entity, the file has been renamed to `entity.ts`.

## Decision
- `draft/state.ts` renamed to `draft/entity.ts`.
- All imports updated accordingly.

## Consequences
Future documentation and API references should use the new name. Build scripts and editors might need to refresh paths.
