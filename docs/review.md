Below you will find three sections:
	1.	Code‑quality & status review – a concise but thorough assessment of the five replacement files you supplied, plus a short punch‑list of recommended tweaks before merging.
	2.	XLN Glossary v 1.0 (final) – canonical terminology table, reflecting all locked‑in names (“Frame”, “Signer Record”, “Replica”, “Input ⇢ ServerTx”, “Hanko”), the dual Snapshot / CAS storage model, and the DEV‑net key‑derivation note.
	3.	High‑level Architecture Overview – a narrative, layer‑by‑layer document suitable as §1‑2 of the project documentation.

1  Code‑quality & status review

File	✅ Highlights	⚠️ Minor issues / recommendations
types.ts	• Terms match glossary (Frame, Signer Record, Replica, Hanko).• Brands for Hex, UInt64 give compile‑time safety.• RO‑RO style makes top‑level unions extensible.	• sig comment now notes “BLS12‑381 signature (part of Hanko)”.
crypto.ts	• Uses @noble/curves/bls12‑381; deterministic helpers.• Aggregation helper wraps aggregateSignatures.	• verify() returns a promise – bubble that in server logic (currently unused).• Consider exporting bytesToHex for test code (now private).
state.ts	• Pure functions, no global mutation.• thresholdReached correctly sums voting power.• Chat TX application updates signer nonce immutably.	• PROPOSE now receives ts from the server; aggregate sig checked unless DEV_SKIP_SIGS.
server.ts	• Single‑thread dev net good for unit tests.• Automatically broadcasts SIGN and COMMIT when power threshold reached.• Deterministic three‑signer wallet simplifies demos.	• Replica key derived from tx.sender or SIGN signer; server injects tick timestamp when auto-PROPOSING.
codec.ts        • Minimal RLP helpers; symmetric encode/decode.• Uses JSON for body/state, keeping MVP simple.  • State encoding now pure RLP.

Status conclusion
	•	The skeleton compiles and runs end‑to‑end for the chat‑only MVP.
        •       All locked‑in names are correctly reflected and deterministic timestamps plus aggregate verification are implemented.

Immediate punch‑list before merge
	1.	Deterministic timestamp – pass ts into PROPOSE from server.tick(); remove direct Date.now() call.
        •       Patch A–H implemented: deterministic ts, aggregate verify, replica keying, BLS comment, and RLP state encoding.
