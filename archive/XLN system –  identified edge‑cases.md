#### 1. High‑level purpose & positioning

* **“Banking network 2.0”**: aims to replace conventional payment rails with **instant, feeless, horizontally‑scalable value transfer**.
* **Security model** presented as *cleaner* and more easily auditable than existing L2 roll‑ups or custodial wallets.
* Target early markets:

  1. **Micropayments in gaming** (in‑game micro‑transactions).
  2. **Streaming / live‑donation platforms**.
  3. **Cross‑border retail FX and OTC exchanges** (P2P “money‑changing” businesses).
  4. Longer‑term: government / bank integrations.

#### 2. Core architectural layers

| Layer                | Role                                                                                                                  | Notes                                                                                                                             |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Server (Replica)** | Collects external messages (“inputs”), batches them every fixed frame (≈ 100 ms), routes to the addressed **Entity**. | No real sockets needed for simulation; messages scripted in tests.                                                                |
| **Entity**           | Primary state machine in a jurisdiction; holds reserve balances; later can open **channels** to peers.                | First public release may ship **Entity‑only (no channels)** to keep surface small; marketed as DAO alternative (vs Aragon, Safe). |
| **Account** (future) | Sub‑machine under Entity; same interface pattern (fractal design).                                                    |                                                                                                                                   |

Characteristics:

* Each layer shares the same abstract interface: *Input → deterministic transition → Outbox* (self‑similar “fractal” composition).
* Implementation style: **pure functional / declarative**, deterministic, stateless processing inside a frame.

#### 3. Message & transaction model

##### 3.1 `Input` (outer message)

```ts
interface Input {
  from   : Address        // sender
  to     : Address        // addressed Entity
  command: Command        // see below
}
```

##### 3.2 `Command` (consensus‑level)

`type` field (aka `command.type`) may be:

* `importEntity` – bootstrap / state sync.
* `addTransactions` – pack one or many user transactions.
* `proposeFrame` – proposer’s candidate block.
* `signFrame` – validator signature for a proposed frame.
* `commitFrame` – proposer declares quorum reached; finalizes frame.

##### 3.3 `Transaction` (application‑level)

```ts
interface Transaction {
  kind      : string   // e.g. "chat" in current PoC
  nonce     : bigint
  signature : bytes     // placeholder in simulation
  // domain‑specific payload goes here
}
```

* No per‑transaction timestamp; ordering is strictly the sequence of inclusion inside a frame.
* **Frame timestamp** is set once by the proposer and written to the frame header.

#### 4. Consensus & frame life‑cycle

1. **Aggregation** – Server collects many `Input`s within the frame window.
2. **Routing** – Server packages them into one `EntityInput` per addressed Entity.
3. **Entity processing** – Executes in deterministic order:

   4. `importEntity` (if any)
   5. batched `addTransactions`
   6. `proposeFrame` (single proposer)
7. **Signing round** – Other validators verify, return `signFrame`.
8. **Commit** – When proposer holds sufficient signatures, it issues `commitFrame`; all replicas move to the new state and emit their **Outbox**.

Edge‑cases called out:

* *Dry‑run / “pre‑commit”*: validators execute proposed block but do **not** mutate local state until `commitFrame` arrives.
* All state changes are deterministic; signature verification stubbed (`1`/`true`) in early simulation.
* “Outbox” messages are queued for the next server frame.

#### 5. Fiat on/off‑ramp & network‑effect challenges

| Problem                             | Proposed mitigation                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Chicken‑and‑egg liquidity**       | Seed liquidity pools for key pairs; focus on one vertical (e.g. game‑dev) first, then reinvest where traction appears.                                   |
| **Fiat bridge**                     | Country‑specific “hub partners” licensed locally (e.g. Russia, UAE, Thailand). They hold banking licences and charge a spread to swap cash ↔ XLN tokens. |
| **P2P cash deals**                  | Still unsolved; requires **escrow / hash‑time‑lock** mechanics not available in legacy rails.                                                            |
| **Rotating savings groups (ROSCA)** | XLN smart entities can replace trust‑based “admin” with deterministic rules, removing single‑point‑of‑failure.                                           |

#### 6. Known limitations in first public milestone

1. **Channels disabled** – only intra‑Entity transfers; reduces cognitive load for early adopters.
2. **Single transaction type (“chat”)** – expansion later.
3. **Signature & KYC checks mocked** – focus is core deterministic ledger.
4. **CLI‑only test‑net** – scripted scenario files instead of real networking.

---

#### 7. Security & user‑experience claims

* **Self‑custody**: funds cannot be seized by wallet operator (“sovereign by design”).
* **Free / near‑zero fee** transfers; cost may be zero in many routings.
* **Instant settlement** inside one frame; scalability achieved by sharding into multiple Entities and later Channels.
* UX goal: *“better than any existing crypto for a casual ‘send money to a friend’ use‑case.”*
